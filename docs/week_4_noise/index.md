Consider the code you would write to draw a colored square. Your code would require several values: horizontal position, vertical position, width, height, the RGB values.

Where do those values come from?

Source          | Purpose
---             | ---
Hard Coded      | You want specific control of the value.
Parameters      | You want to be able to control the value from a larger context.
`random()`      | You want random variation.
`noise(x)`      | You want controlled variation.

Often you use these in combination:
`width = 100 + random(-10, 10);`

Using `random()` is a good way to add variation to a value. The `noise(x)` can often offer variation with greater control and consistency.

## Benefits of Noise

### Noise is Coherent
The `noise(x)` function returns values sampled from Perlin Noise. Perlin Noise provides random values that are aesthetically arranged ([band limited and visually isotropic](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems/gpugems_ch05.html)) in space. These values are a useful basis for many applications that require natural-feeling variation.

### Noise is Repeatable
Repeated variation is easy with `noise(x)`: every time you call `noise(x)` with a particular argument, you get the same value back. This is often very useful. For example, in an animation you often need variation to be consistent from frame to frame.

- `random()` requires no arguments and returns a different random value every time
- `noise(x)` requires an argument and returns the same random value every time
- This difference takes some getting used to, and learning what to pass in for `x` takes some practice.
- This difference is a core reason why `noise(x)` is so useful.

### Noise is Controllable
By controlling what you pass to `noise(x)`, you can control the frequency of the random values returned. This can be used to control how quickly values vary in space and time. Like `random()` values, you can scale and shift the values from `noise(x)` to the range you need. You can also adjust the character of `noise(x)` using `noiseDetail()`.

# Working with Noise

## Calling the Noise Function

When you call `noise(x)` you have to pass in an `x` value. This x value is the location in the Perlin Noise of the value to return. Choose `x` based on how you want the value to vary. You can pass in `frameCount` or `millis()` to get values that change over time.
`noise()` actually takes up to three parameters: `noise(x,y,z)` allowing you to receive values arranged in three dimensions (see below).

## Controlling the Frequency
You can control how quickly returned values will vary over time and space by scaling the value you pass in for `x`.

```
n = noise(frameCount); // get a value that changes over time
n = noise(frameCount * .1); // get a value that changes over time slowly
n = noise(frameCount * 10); // get a value that changes over time quickly
```

## Controlling the Amplitude and Range
The `noise(x)` function returns values in the range of 0 to 1. Use multiplication and addition to shift this range to the range you need.

```
n = noise(frameCount) * 10 + 10; // values between 10 and 20;
```

You could also use `map()`:

```
n = noise(frameCount); // 0 -> 1
n = map(n, 0, 1, 10, 20);  // map to 10 -> 20
```

## Controlling the Detail

The `noiseDetail()`  function allows you to control the "roughness" or "detail" of the noise returned. See: [p5 reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noiseDetail)


## Controlling the Seed
By default, every time you restart your sketch the noise pattern will be different. The `noiseSeed()` allows you to manually set the noise pattern seed. See: [p5 reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noiseSeed)

# Assignment
Keep Sketching! This week, focus on using the `noise()` function. Use `noise()` in a variety of ways. Use 1D, 2D, and 3D noise. Try using high, mid, and low frequency noise. Try using noise to control different things: position, size, color, rotation, etc. Think about tile graphics, `random()`, and parameters while you work. Consider combining these concepts with `noise()`.


## Special Assignment
Don't forget to sign up for orientations for the Laser Cutter and 3D printer.

## Challenge
Make a program that generates treasure maps.

Your maps should:
- Describe the geography of a fictional territory
- Mark the location of the treasure
- Include a path to the treasure from a reference point
- Be expressed in a cohesive style

Things to consider:
- Where is you treasure? On a tropical island? A farm? In a warehouse?
- What style is your map?
- Does your map include labels? What do they say?
- Can you make a believable, natural geography? Should you?
- What terrain features might you include? Rivers? Mountains? Hills? Boxes?
- It is okay if your map takes seconds, or even minutes to generate. Does allow you to do something different?

When posting your map:
- Include three maps generated by your program.
- Each map should be shown as an image, not video.
- Consider posting a first run at this challenge early, and then revisiting towards the end of the week with a second post.
