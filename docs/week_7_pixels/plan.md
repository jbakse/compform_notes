# Challenge Ideas

`sampler` In cross-stiching and embroidery samplers are work pieces created to demonstrate skill. They usually feature an alphabet, and a quote, with the content be secondary to the craft. Play off of this idea by making a sketch that processes an image of the alphabet. Sample Samplers

`ouroboros` Feed one of your screengrabs from an early sketch into a new sketch. Feed the result back into itself. Post all three images.

`pixels_plus_tiles` Combine pixel processing with a tile set.

`GIGO` Garbage In Garbage Out. Subvert the concept of GIGO by making a program that takes an uninteresting image and makes an interesting one.
