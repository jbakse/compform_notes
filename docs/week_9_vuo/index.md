# Assignment

Keep Sketching!

This week explore using Vuo and node-based programming. The focus this week is on the tool rather than the form, so use Vuo to create whatever you like: images, animation, video processors, or interactive experiences.

## Challenge: Synesthesia
Create a Vuo sketch that creates a "music visualization", an animation driven by sound input. In today's lecture we discussed the relationship between computers and our senses of sound and vision. Can you create a visualization that allows us to see something in the music that is difficult to hear?

## Machines
- A bicycle, crank, chain, wheel.

## Electricity
- [Periodic Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table)
- [Electron Shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_shell) 2, 8, 18, 32, 50, 72
- [Copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper) 2, 8, 18, 1

- Conductive materials allow electrically charged particles to flow
- Charge particles with the same polarity repel each other
- Those particles can be pushed along by magnets (among other things)
- Those particles push into other particles, pushing them along.
- The pushing propagates very quickly, though the particles may progress slowly.
- The particles may just move a little bit back and forth.
- This all works backwards too, the moving charged particles can push back on magnets.

- Motor to Motor
- Motor to Light
- Motor to Speaker
- Switches

## Switches + Logic

- Two Switch AND
- Two Switch OR
- Transistors


## Computers

- Computers are (very complex) physical machines.
- We build layers and layer of abstractions on these machines, but at their core they are physically rooted.
- Bits and Atoms are very different in some important ways, but computers are still made out of atoms.
- [Apple IIc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIc) WDC_65C02, 11,500 transistors, 1.023 MHz
- I litterally can't understand the complexity of computers today.
- A modern CPU contains 1,000,000,000+ transistors [Transistor Count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count)
- A GPU may have 10,000,000,000
- Runs at 2,3,4+ GHz
- Squeezed into ~250mm2
- Transistors are ~20 nm
- A hair is about 75 μm wide.
- 3750

## Inputs and Outputs
- All these switches just do the same thing as our physical switches, they allow/block the passage of electric current.
- They can allow current to flow to LED's in your monitor
- They can allow current to flow to the speakers
- They can allow current to flow to ports
- They can allow current to flow into an antenna.
- The switches are controlled by current.
- Current coming from physical switches on your keyboard.
- Sent from other devices like your mouse.
- Stimulated in photo-sensitive sensors in a digital camera.
- By a magnet in your microphone.
- By radio waves hitting an antenna.
