		You are <input id="age-input" type="range" min="0" max="99" value="20"> <span id="age">20</span> years old.
		<p>

		<p>
		According to the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html">Social Security Adminstration</a>, if you are male you have about a <span id="male-death-chance">.1%</span> chance of dying in the next year, but you will probably live another <span id="male-years-left">57</span> years.
		</p>

		<p>
		If you are female, you'll probably live a little longer: <span id="female-years-left">57</span> more years.  There is still about a <span id="female-death-chance">.1%</span> chance you'll die in the next year though.
		</p>

		<p>
		Anyway, you probably have about <span id="percent-left">30%</span> of your life left. Have fun.
