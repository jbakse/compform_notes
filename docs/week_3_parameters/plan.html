			<h1>Week 3 - Parameters</h1>
<p>This lesson explores the relationship between software interfaces and parameters. It sets students up to begin considering which parameters they should expose in the their own work as the explore other topics throughout the semester.</p>
<h2>Learners</h2>
<ul>
<li>16 Students</li>
<li>Students in this class come from the BFA Communication Design, BFA Design and Technology, and MFA Design and Technology.</li>
<li>They have a wide variety of incoming programming skills, but all are interested in using code within their own creative work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Integrated Skills</h2>
<p>Speaking
Writing
Vocabulary
Culture
Interface Design
Problem Analysis</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider interface design as exposing parameters</li>
<li>Practice problem analysis and interface design</li>
<li>Practice user-centered design concepts</li>
<li>Consider role of “choices” and “options”</li>
<li>Technical: Exposing Parameters as Globals</li>
<li>Technical: Exposing Parameters with HTML Controls</li>
</ul>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>Workshop decks: 'Machine Types’, ‘User Types’
Example Slides and Class Notes: <a href="http://compform.net/week_3_parameters/">http://compform.net/week_3_parameters/</a></p>

<h2>Activity Details</h2>
<h3>Homework Review</h3>
<p>Background: This class explores a new theme each week. Students are asked to maintain a daily practice of sketching and ideation, exploring ideas related to each weeks theme through out the semester. Sketches are posted to class website where students can review each others work throughout the week.</p>
<p>Review Activity: Students are divided into groups. Each group is given a question related to the past week’s homework or theme. Groups are asked to present an answer to their question to the class, using a sketch form the past week.</p>
<h3>Slides / Discussion</h3>
<p>I will present slides showing a wide variety of art, design projects, and software interfaces related to this weeks themes. I will speak only briefly about each slide, and ask students questions related to how parameters were used by the artists and designers of the work shown.</p>
<p>Note: I hope to blend this section and the next section together.</p>
<h3>Parameters Lecture</h3>
<p>I will present key points on parametric design, parameters, and user interfaces. Concepts will be supported with examples.</p>
<h3>Fictional Machines</h3>
<p>Students will be divided into groups.</p>
<p>Each group will draw a card from two decks. The first deck will contain prompts for fictional machines/products: &quot;Grocery-shopping Robot&quot;, &quot;Love Potion Mixer&quot;. The second deck will contain prompts for types of users: &quot;Daily User&quot;, &quot;Child&quot;.</p>
<p>Groups will be asked to consider possible parameters related to their machine and which parameters to expose based on their type of user.</p>
<p>Groups will present their interface designs to class.</p>
<h3>Globals and Sliders Lecture</h3>
<p>Introduction to how to organize and document parameters as global variables in a program.
Introduction to creating a user interface using web form controls using the p5.js library.
Students will also be shown documentation and example projects for later reference.</p>
<h3>Project Retro-fit</h3>
<p>Students will be asked to choose one assignment from the past week, and expand the project by adding a simple user-interface.</p>
