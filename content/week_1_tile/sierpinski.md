# Sierpinski
## Please take out a sheet of paper and pen and follow these instructions:

### 1. Draw an up-pointing, equilateral triangle that fills most of the page.
### 2. Lightly mark the midpoint of each line of that triangle.
### 3. Draw straight lines connecting each of those marks. This forms four new triangles: three that point up, one that points down.
### 4. Choose any empty, up-pointing triangle on the page.
### 5. Go to instruction 2.

Yes, these instructions will go on forever. I'll interrupt you in a minute.
