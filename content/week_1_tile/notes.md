## Assignment 2 â€” Research
This week, in addition to your normal daily experiment posting, I'd like you to spend some time online looking at what others have done.

Find and explore web sites related to computational form and procedural generation. Post one link to the class blog every day this week. With each link posting include an image and a one sentence description of the site. Try to find a variety of links, and include hash tags below if applicable.

Tags: `#artist`, `#tool`, `#language`, `#article`, `#book`, `#image`, `#video`, `#sound`
