# Learning Objectives
- What a noise function is.
- Why noise is useful.
- Noise vs. Random
- Historical and Current Importance of (Perlin) Noise in Procedural Generation
- Qualities of Noise (Smoothing, Layering, Frequency, Energy, Dimensions)
- How to use noise in projects. (Sampling, Input Scaling, Output Scaling)


Introduction

Blue Square: Horizontal Position, Vertical, Width, Height, Color (RGB)
When you use code draw this square you have to provide values.
Where do those values come from?
- Hard Coded
- Random
- Parameters (From Globals or UI)
Often in combination: width = 100 + random(-10, 10);
Random is useful when you want to add some variation.
[ellipse changing size over time, ellipse changing size over position]

A new (often better) option: Noise.
Noise is great when you want to add variation over a dimension.
