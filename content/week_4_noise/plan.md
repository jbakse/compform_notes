# Welcome Music

# Materials
Team Generator, 1D Noise Worksheet

# Learning Objectives
- What a noise function is.
- Why noise is useful.
- Noise vs. Random
- Historical and Current Importance of (Perlin) Noise in Procedural Generation
- Qualities of Noise (Smoothing, Layering, Frequency, Energy, Dimensions)
- How to use noise in projects. (Sampling, Input Scaling, Output Scaling)

Notes


# What Noise Is
Its a source of stable, deterministic, coherent "random" variation.
Show `random()` driven ellipse (size/time).
Show `noise()` driven ellipse (size/time).
Show `random()` driven ellipse (size/place).
Show `noise()` driven ellipse (size/place).
Use low octives for these demos. Show control over frequency.

Procedural


 # Noise Examples
- Perlin Noise
- Fractal Perlin Noise
- 2D Terrain
- 3D Terrain with Mesh Displacement
- [Fireball](https://www.clicktorelease.com/blog/vertex-displacement-noise-3d-webgl-glsl-three-js)
- [Wood](http://lodev.org/cgtutor/randomnoise.html)
