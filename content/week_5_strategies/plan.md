Why not Pure Random?


- Scattering Points Case Studies
    - Pure Random
    - Grid + Random
    - Grid + Random + Noise?
    - Noise
    - Noise + Dither?
    - Pre-place rule
        Poison Disk Sampling?
        Mitchellâ€™s best-candidate
    - Post Processing: Relaxing
    - Generate and Test -> Solution finding, genentic algos.
    - mixed authorship (placing modules at random)

- Case Studies

- Desirable Properties of a PCG solution (http://pcgbook.com/wp-content/uploads/chapter01.pdf)
    - Speed
    - Reliability
    - Controllability
    - Expressivity and Diversity
    - Creativity and Believability



# Challenges

# Hand-off Challenge
Part 1: Create a sketch. Post it. Hand the code to someone else.
Part 2: Receive code from someone else. Modify it. Post.

#

# Reading Reach Chapter 1 of PCGBook
- Has tons of references to games, techniques, etc. Follow them!
- Spelunky Video
